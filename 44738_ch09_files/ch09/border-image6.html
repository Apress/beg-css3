    <p>&ldquo;You are old, Father William,&rdquo; the young man said,
  &ldquo;And your hair has become very white;
And yet you incessantly stand on your head—
  Do you think, at your age, it is right?&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;In my youth,&rdquo; Father William replied to his son,
  &ldquo;I feared it might injure the brain;
But, now that I&rsquo;m perfectly sure I have none,
  Why, I do it again and again.&rdquo;</p>
